# Socket programming in python
client-server application in python using both UDP and TCP protocols

# Problem Description
This problem is based on socket implementation using python3.<br>The client side sends a message to the server and responds a reply for the message.<br>When the server receives a message from a client, it simply...<br>
- Reverse all the characters
- Reverse the capitalization of the strings<br>
And then send back the response to the client.

# what are Sockets ?
Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.<br>
Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: *TCP, UDP,* and so on.
